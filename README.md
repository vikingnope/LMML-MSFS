# <ins>LMML for MSFS<ins/>

### This is my rendition of Malta International Airport(LMML) for MSFS. It should be the most up-to-date version of the airport, surpassing payware airports. This will be released as a freeware later on.

#### Y'all can view the progress at this [project site](https://github.com/users/vikingnope/projects/5).

#### Also donations are accepted as these help contribute to more development in the future:
