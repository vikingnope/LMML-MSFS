# <ins>LMML for MSFS<ins/>

### This is my rendition of Malta International Airport(LMML) for MSFS. It should be the most up-to-date version of the airport using Google Maps. This has been released as a freeware airport and can either be downloaded from the GitHub release page or from Flightsim.to

#### Y'all can view the progress at this [project site](https://github.com/users/vikingnope/projects/5).
